\chapter*{Abstract}

The EarlyCare Gateway project addresses critical challenges in the contemporary healthcare landscape, specifically targeting the issues of preliminary analysis. This work presents a Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS) designed to assist doctors through a multimodal AI analysis approach.

The system integrates a set of Artificial Intelligence models to process clinical data. It employs a fine-tuned ClinicalBERT and Gemini 2.5 Flash-Lite for the analysis of unstructured textual symptoms and ECG signals, CheXNet and EfficientNet for the classification of chest X-rays and skin lesions, and XGBoost for cardiovascular risk prediction based on structured tabular data. The solution is built upon a containerized microservices architecture, ensuring high cohesion and low coupling, as well as traceability and data protection.

Experimental validation demonstrates the system's reliability across all strategies. The textual analysis module achieved an accuracy of 88\%, while the computer vision components demonstrated a Mean AUC of 0.837 for chest X-rays and an accuracy of 88\% for skin lesion diagnosis. Furthermore, the cardiovascular risk prediction model reached a recall of 85.3\%.

A central focus of the research is the implementation of Explainable AI (XAI) techniques, including SHAP, Grad-CAM, and Chain-of-Thought reasoning, that mitigate the black-box problem of AI models in critical fields, such as clinical applications.

abstract="The book which first raised awareness of the concept of design patterns and is still widely cited by any wiki, web site or book on design patterns is Design Patterns book. The four authors, Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson and John Vlissides (collectively known as the ``Gang of Four'', or GoF for short) popularized the patterns concepts and ideals. The patterns in this book are often referred to as GoF Patterns and the book as the GoF patterns book (to distinguish it from various other books with similar titles).",

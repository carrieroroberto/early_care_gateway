\chapter*{Abstract}

The EarlyCare Gateway system presents a comprehensive, AI-driven clinical decision support system designed to enhance the triage and diagnostic workflow for medical professionals.

The system integrates multiple types of clinical data, including textual notes, medical images, and physiological signals, and leverages advanced Artificial Intelligence models, such as ClinicalBERT, Convolutional Neural Networks, Large Language Models, and XGBoost, to provide accurate and interpretable diagnostic predictions. A strong emphasis is placed on explainability, using SHAP for post-hoc model interpretation and Chain of Thought techniques to generate transparent reasoning for Large Language Models.

It is built upon a containerized microservices architecture that ensures modularity, scalability, and maintainability, with secure and traceable data handling via authentication, audit logging, and anonymization mechanisms. The system design incorporates structural and behavioral software design patterns to achieve high cohesion, low coupling, and flexible integration of AI strategies.

Performance evaluation demonstrates both the reliability of the AI predictions and the efficiency of the distributed system in clinical scenarios.
